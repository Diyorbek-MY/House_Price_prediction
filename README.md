🏡 California Housing Value Prediction

This project is a beginner-level machine learning pipeline that predicts the median house value in California using popular Python data science libraries. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling using Linear Regression and Random Forest, along with cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
📌 Project Highlights

    📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
    🧹 Data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature scaling
    
    🤖 Machine Learning using:

        Linear Regression
        Random Forest Regressor
    ✅ Cross-validation for model evaluation

📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the California Housing dataset, which is available through Scikit-learn.

It contains features like:

    Median income
    House age
    Average rooms
    Population
    Proximity to the ocean
    And more...

🧠 Goal

The goal is to predict the median house value in various districts in California based on available features.

This project helped me practice:

    Data visualization
    Feature engineering
    Building and comparing ML models
    Evaluating performance with cross-validation

🛠 Technologies Used

    Python
    Pandas
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn

🧩 Future Improvements

    Hyperparameter tuning
    Adding more visualizations
    Trying other models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting
    Deploying the model with a simple web app (e.g., using Streamlit)
